# Udacity - Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Program

I took this program in 2021. The goal of this program is to get you familiarized with combining sensor data of:

* `Lidar/Radar` for recognizing surrounding vehicles and predict their positions and speeds
* `Lidar/Camera` for estimating time-to-collision of preceding vehicles

## Installation

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/PoChang007/Sensor_Fusion_Nanodegree.git`
2. Install Git [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

Each project can be built individually in its folder. See the instruction in each project folder.

Below are the projects I worked on:

## Project 1 - Lidar Obstacle Detection
